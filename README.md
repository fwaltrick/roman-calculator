# Roman Numerals Calculator
A calculator that can add, subtract and multiply Roman numerals 🏛 

## Built with
* <b>React Hooks</b> – For all the UI components 
* <b>JavaScript</b> – To handle calcutions and validations (with Regex)
* <b>CSS</b> – No frameworks here. Just pure CSS (with variables, Flexbox, Grid and some media queries).
* <b>SVG</b> - For the images and logo 
* <b>Parcel</b> – As the code bundler
* <b>Jest</b> and <b>React Testing Library</b> – For unit testing

## Tooling 
Regarding quality code — formatting and style —, I resorted to the combination of <b>Prettier</b> and <b>ESLint</b>.

## Installation
Run:
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

The app will be available on `http://localhost:1234`
